Going out together
How you're incredibly honest with me
That you're honest with me about how you're feeling
How open-minded you are
How well we communicate
Your sense of humor
Dreaming about you
Trying new things together
How relaxed I can feel around around you
That you value my fashion opinion
Your freakish memory for dates
Your nose
The funny and interesting things you send me throughout the day
How you worry about me
That I can tell you anything
how you make me feel like I'm worth something
The way your voice sounds when you're blushing
Your brain
You let me be there for you
When we think the same things
That you push me to exercise
Your smile
How much thought you put into the gifts you've given me
That you're capable of most anything you set your mind to
That you bake
How we can have a conversation about almost anything
That I still learn new things about you
How much you've helped me learn about myself
How much of a badass you were when you decided what car you wanted
The way you smell
Your facial expressions
Hearing about your day
When you ask me to stay an extra day

How clean you are
How much fun we have
You push me to be the best version of myself, always
That you're building a career you're passionate about
How compassionate you are
Your curiosity
That you think I'm funny
The way I still get excited when my phone goes off, hoping it's from you
Your dedication to exercise
When you touch my face when we kiss
How creative you are
The way you unstand me like no one has
How much of a catalyst our conversations have been in the evolution of my thinking
That I can show off my accomplishments to you
That you named your stuffed cat "Cat"
That you sleep with Cat
How much I admire you
Your love of learning
The sound of your laugh
You have my back
You still accept me, even knowing my flaws
Dancing with you

That you think I'm talented
The way you kiss
When you give me compliments, because I know I can believe them
Your handwriting

The way you look in pajamas
Watching you dance
That you love music
How much I can trust you
The way you feel when I hold you
Discussing our wedding plans
How encouraging you are
That you think I'm intelligent
The way you do your hair
Being seen with you in public
How alike we are, especially in deep, non-obvious ways
That you want to marry me
How many hours we can spend talking on the phone
Your natural computer talents
You haven't given up on me
Your lips
Your eyes
How put-together and organized you are
Your hands
Watching movies with you
How you let me rant and ramble
Your posture
How you're always seeking to better yourself
How you look something up as soon as you realize you don't know the answer
The way your breathing changes when I touch you (in the ;-) sense)
That you think I'm beauitful
The way we can break almost anything down in conversation
How unique you are amoung all the people I've encountered in my life
How much thought you put into the things that matter to you and why
How much thought you put into everything you do
How tall you are
That you got me into Doctor Who
That you keep helping push me past my fears of dancing
That you help push me past my fears in everything
